Deploying a Prototype Webapp of a Bank Login Page Using Docker:
In this project I created an ASP.NET Core web application containing two cshtml pages:
Login page for a customer
Dashboard page which will show a few buttons for account-related activities and a logout button which will send him back to the login page by created razor pages with respective controllers.
Then, I created docker support file and published it. I was able to save the image in my docker desktop and  deploy web application successfully.
